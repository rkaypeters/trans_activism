            <p>Only three months into 2021, US state legislators have introduced <a href = "https://www.advocate.com/transgender/2021/3/12/record-number-anti-trans-bills-introduced-states-year" >
                an historic</a>
                number of new bills that threaten the rights of transgender people — 93, as of 
                this writing. During the 2020 session, a staggering 79 anti-transgender bills 
                were filed, the previous record-high. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Several of the bills in the current session specifically <a href = https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/mar/29/arkansas-transgender-healthcare-ban-minors>target trans children</a>, who 
                would be barred from accessing gender-affirming healthcare and participating in 
                athletics with their cisgender peers. Even in areas where these bills are unlikely to pass, just introducing them is harmful to trans people, especially children who are greater social and emotional risk than their peers.
                <br>
                <br>
                This wave of discriminatory policy has ignited public discourse and calls for action have 
                resounded on Twitter under the hashtag #TransRightsAreHumanRights.

            <p> Anti-transgender legislation is not just increasing but changing in type. While in 2018 and 2019 bills 
                legislating bathrooms were more common, legislation in 2020 and 2021 largely focuses on 
                participation in sports and healthcare access for transgender children.

                Tweets were gathered from a full archive search of the Twitter API v2. We queried tweets from 1/01/20 to 3/26/21 that 
                included "#TransRightsAreHumanRights" and filtered for those containing place information at the city level.
                Coordinates for each tweet were calculated by first averaging the bounding box coordinates marking the city
                and then applying a random jitter to avoid point overlap.
                
                Anti-trans bill information was gathered from the ACLU's page on <a href = https://www.aclu.org/legislation-affecting-lgbt-rights-across-country>Legislation Affecting LGBTQ Rights Across the Country</a> 
                and was last updated on 3/17/21.
